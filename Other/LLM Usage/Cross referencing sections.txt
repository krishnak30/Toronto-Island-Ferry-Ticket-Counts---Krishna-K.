In Quarto, you can cross-reference sections by using the heading's automatically generated identifier or label and referring to it in your text. Here's how you can do it:

### 1. **Add Labels to Headings**
When you create a heading, Quarto automatically generates an ID based on the text. For instance, if you have a section heading like this:

```markdown
## Data and Methodology
```

The ID generated would be `#data-and-methodology`. You can also add your own custom ID if you want more control:

```markdown
## Data and Methodology {#data-method}
```

### 2. **Cross-Reference in Your Text**
You can then refer to this section in other parts of your document by using the following syntax:

```markdown
See [Section 2](#data-method) for more details on the data and methodology.
```

When Quarto renders the document, this will turn into a clickable link to the section.

### 3. **Automatically Reference Section Numbers**

If you want to reference the section number automatically instead of just creating a clickable link, use `@` followed by the ID:

```markdown
See @data-method for more details on the data and methodology.
```

Quarto will automatically replace this with the correct section number in your output document, like:

"See Section 2 for more details on the data and methodology."

### 4. **Table of Contents**
If you're using a table of contents (TOC), Quarto will also automatically generate links for you to cross-reference sections within the TOC.

You can add a TOC with this YAML option at the top of your Quarto document:

```yaml
toc: true
toc-depth: 2
```

This will create a clickable table of contents with links to your headings.
