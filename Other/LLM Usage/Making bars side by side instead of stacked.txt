How do i make the bars in the histogram side by side instead of stacked on each other? you can barely see the blue ones

monthly_summary <- cleaned_ticket_counts_data %>%
  group_by(Month) %>%
  summarize(
    Total_Sold = sum(Tickets_Sold, na.rm = TRUE),
    Total_Redeemed = sum(Tickets_Redeemed, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(Total_Sold, Total_Redeemed), 
               names_to = "Ticket_Type", 
               values_to = "Total_Count")

ggplot(monthly_summary, aes(x = Month, fill = Ticket_Type)) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = Total_Count), stat = "identity", position = "dodge", alpha = 0.7) +
  ...
