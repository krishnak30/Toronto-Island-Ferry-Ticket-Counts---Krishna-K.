User: 

the table is too wide and goes out of the page, or the column names overlap with each other. 

what is a simple way to get the model summary table?

ChatGPT:

kable(summary_table, caption = "Table 2: Summary Statistics of Ticket Counts") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE) %>%  # Make sure the table is not full width
  column_spec(1:5, width = "3cm")         # Adjust column widths
