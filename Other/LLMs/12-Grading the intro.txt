ok what would you grade this intro accoridng to the rubric then:

The Toronto Islands are a collection of small islands located off the southern shore of Toronto, Canada. Known for their scenic beauty and recreational activities, they serve as a popular vacation spot for tourists and locals alike. The islands feature beaches, parks, restaurants, and other attractions, making them a prime destination. As one of the few natural escapes in the urban Toronto lifestyle, the islands play an important role in the city's environmental balance. Access to the Toronto islands is exclusively provided by the ferry services (except by private water taxis) operated by the Toronto Parks, Forestry, and Recreational Department. These ferries carry thousands of visitors daily, especially during peak season, and are essential in the functioning of the islands.

This paper analyzes the ferry ticket sales and redemption data from the Toronto Islands Ferry Service over the following time period: 1st of January, 2018 to the 20th of September, 2024. While previous studies have on the popularity of the Toronto Islands, little attention has been given to the usage patterns of the ferry service, especially during external shocks such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the ferry's role as the primary means of transportation to the islands, understanding these usage patterns is critical for officials, policymakers, stakeholders, and business owners to improve service efficiency, manage fluctuating demand, and develop contingency plans. The significance of this research goes well beyond the ferry system, having impacts on issues of urban mobility, tourism management, and even economic recovery in a post-pandemic society.

The paper begins with a comprehensive overview of the chosen data set, detailing the data collection methods, critical data cleaning details, and statistical tools/resources employed for the analysis. We conducted a time series analysis of ticket sales and redemption patterns and visualized this data to reveal significant seasonal trends, with notable peaks during the summer months and sharp declines during the pandemic. Lastly, we discuss the implications of our findings and the broader context they serve, emphasizing how understanding visitor patterns can enhance service efficiency and inform adaptive strategies to address future challenges.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides an in-depth discussion of the data, including its source, the critical aspects of the cleaning process, preparation for analysis, and a thorough discussion of the broader context. Section 3 presents a detailed analysis of ticket sales and redemption patterns, highlighting key trends, seasonal variations, and the impact of external factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, section 4 discusses the implications of these findings, explores potential applications, and addresses the limitations of this study, offering suggestions for future research.

This is the rubric: 

This criterion is linked to a Learning OutcomeIntroduction
