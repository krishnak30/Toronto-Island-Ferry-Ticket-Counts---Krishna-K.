You can filter your cleaned dataset to include only the data from January 1, 2018, to September 20, 2024, using the filter() function from the dplyr package. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

r
Copy code
library(dplyr)

# Filtering the data for the desired date range
filtered_ticket_counts_data <- cleaned_ticket_counts_data %>%
  filter(Date >= as.Date("2018-01-01") & Date <= as.Date("2024-09-20"))

# Checking the filtered dataset
head(filtered_ticket_counts_data)
Explanation:
filter(): This function allows you to specify conditions for subsetting the data.
Date >= as.Date("2018-01-01"): This condition ensures that only rows with a date on or after January 1, 2018, are included.
Date <= as.Date("2024-09-20"): This condition ensures that only rows with a date on or before September 20, 2024, are included.
Saving the Filtered Data
If you want to save this filtered dataset for later use, you can write it to a new CSV file like this:

r
Copy code
write_csv(
  x = filtered_ticket_counts_data,
  file = "Data/Analysis_Data/filtered_ticket_counts_data.csv"
)
This way, your filtered dataset will be saved separately, and you can use it for your analyses without affecting the original dataset. Let me know if you have any further questions!
