ASKED HOW TO SEPARATE A DTTM COLUMN INTO TWO DATE AND TIME COLUMNS

You can use the `separate()` function to split a `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` formatted column into four separate columns: one for the year, one for the month, one for the day, and one for the time (hours, minutes, and seconds). Here's an example of how to do this:

### Code Example

```r
cleaned_data <- 
  raw_data |> 
  separate(col = date_time_column, 
           into = c("year", "month", "day", "time"), 
           sep = "[- ]")
```

### Explanation:
- **`separate(col = date_time_column, into = c("year", "month", "day", "time"), sep = "[- ]")`:**
  - **`date_time_column`** is the name of the column that contains the `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` values.
  - **`into = c("year", "month", "day", "time")`**: This creates four new columns:
    - `year` for the `YYYY` part.
    - `month` for the `MM` part.
    - `day` for the `DD` part.
    - `time` for the `HH:MM:SS` part.
  - **`sep = "[- ]"`**: This tells `separate()` to split the data wherever it finds a hyphen (`-`) or a space (` `). The hyphen is used to separate the year, month, and day, and the space separates the date from the time.

### After running this code:
- The `date_time_column` will be split into four new columns: `year`, `month`, `day`, and `time`.
