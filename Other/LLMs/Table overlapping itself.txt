is completely overlapping itself in the document, completely unreadable

To fix the table rendering and ensure it's displayed properly, you can adjust the `kable` function options to handle formatting and alignment. Here's an updated version of your code that includes some modifications to improve the table's readability in the PDF:

### Use `kableExtra` for better table formatting
- If you haven't already, install the `kableExtra` package to enhance your tables.
- Then you can apply formatting options to avoid overlapping issues.

```r
#| label: tbl-summary
#| tbl-cap: "Summary Statistics of Ticket Counts"
#| warning: false
#| echo: false
#| message: false

# Load necessary libraries
library(kableExtra)
library(dplyr)

# Generate the summary table
summary_table <- cleaned_ticket_counts_data %>%
    summarize(
        Total_Redemption_Tickets = sum(Tickets_Redeemed, na.rm = TRUE),
        Total_Sales_Tickets = sum(Tickets_Sold, na.rm = TRUE),
        Average_Redemption_Tickets = mean(Tickets_Redeemed, na.rm = TRUE),
        Average_Sales_Tickets = mean(Tickets_Sold, na.rm = TRUE),
        Max_Redemption_Tickets = max(Tickets_Redeemed, na.rm = TRUE),
        Max_Sales_Tickets = max(Tickets_Sold, na.rm = TRUE),
        Count = n()
    )

# Create the table with kableExtra for better rendering
kable(summary_table, caption = "Table 2: Summary Statistics of Ticket Counts") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"), 
                full_width = FALSE, 
                position = "center")
```

### Key Additions:
- `kable_styling()`: This function from the `kableExtra` package provides better control over table styling. The options ensure the table is centered and uses compact formatting.
  - `bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed")`: Adds styling options to make the table more readable.
  - `full_width = FALSE`: Keeps the table compact.
  - `position = "center"`: Ensures the table is centered in the PDF.

This should fix the overlap and formatting issues while keeping the table readable and well-presented in the PDF output.
