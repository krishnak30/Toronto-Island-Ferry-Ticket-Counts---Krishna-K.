# Introduction

# Data

-   Can add summary stats of the data for the reader to get a better idea

-   Like just have the average, standard deviation, maybe a QQ plot or smth

# Results

# Discussion

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
