# Overview

This repository provides readers with all the data and code required to run the Toronto Island Ferry Ticket Count Project. This project is focused on analyzing sales and redemption ticket data from the Toronto Islands Ferry Service, through the time period of January 2018 to September 2024. The project aims to analyze consumer behavior, seasonality, and the effects of external events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, on ferry usage and hence, on the popularity of Toronto Islands. Being the sole mode of transport to the islands, the ferry service plays a large role in local tourism and recreation, and has broader implications for operational strategies, policy making, and contingency planning.

Through visualizations and data analysis, this project can offer insights that can benefit business owners, government officials, and the public in optimizing the ferry service.
